 * \brief Internal definitions for TDK/Chirp ICU ultrasonic sensors.
 *
 * This file contains various hardware-defined values for ICU series sensors,
 * including ICU-20201.
 
 * You should not need to edit this file or call the driver functions directly.  Doing so
 * will reduce your ability to benefit from future enhancements and releases from Chirp.
